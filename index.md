## About me:

Hi! My name Maria-Theresa and I am 17 years old. I'm a 12th grade student at the Elisabeth von Thadden School. I have always been fascinated by [MINT](https://master-mint.de/): Mathematics, Informatics, Natural Science, and Technology subjects ([more info](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINT-F%C3%A4cher)), therefore I started to do small MINT projects very early on. Now, as I have gained more understanding of these topics, I am more and more interested in Informatics, especially in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). I am also very interested in medicine and biology. 

In my free time, I play sports. I have been playing tennis since I was 7 years old, but since 2015 I am focussing more on golf, which now I play at competitive level. 

I also love to play piano, which I have been learning for more then 9 years.

### EMBL Teens Project

I am a part of EMBL Teens club at the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)](https://www.embl.de/), Heidelberg. EMBL is Europe’s flagship laboratory for the life sciences. 

> EMBL Teens is a club run by *Friends of EMBL* for the high school students interested in life sciences. As members, we get the chance to look at scientific research from a different angle, in exchange for our passion and interest."

I had an opportunity to attend the EMBL Researcher's night last year as EMBL Teen Reporter, which was featured in [this article](https://news.embl.de/events/ern2018/).

This year I am participating in a project called **Women in Science: Courage to Succeed**.

From July to September, the 'Friends of EMBL' department is running this project with the EMBL Teens club. A few girls from EMBL Teens, including me, are paired with a woman researcher at EMBL where we will take mentorship roles of mentees and mentors. The EMBL researchers will introduce us to their research work, tell us about their life as a scientist and share a few important skills that have been useful for them. 

I will exchange my interests in computational biology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, with Dr. Malvika Sharan - a computational biologist and community outreach coordinator at EMBL. I will spend a few days with her at EMBL, getting to know her work, and learning about careers in academia from a woman's perspective. 

I will attend the European Researchers’ Night taking place at EMBL on 27 September 2019 and participate in an exhibition by sharing the outcome of my project in the form of visual display, video or presentation.
